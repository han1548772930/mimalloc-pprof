/* The free-arena reclaim -- `mi_purge_all_ex(MI_PURGE_RECLAIM)` (docs/arena-reclaim.md).

   WHAT THIS PROVES

   A1  the workload really reserves extra arenas (the precondition of every row below);
   A2  WITHOUT the flag nothing is ever released: the same call with the same live set leaves
       the arena accounting byte-for-byte unchanged (positive control for the flag itself);
   A3  with the flag, every arena that is completely free is released, the live objects in the
       arenas that are NOT free survive byte-for-byte, `arenas_kept == 0` (no arena was left
       behind that the reclaim could have released), and the `committed` statistic loses the
       released arenas' own commit -- never the reservation, and never more than it holds;
   A4  the accounting moves by exactly the reported `arena_reclaim_bytes`, and after the last
       live object is gone the remaining arenas go too -- i.e. the metadata follows the LIVE set
       and not the process's peak;
   A5  (MI_DEBUG only) the safety rule: a thread that is INSIDE the allocator -- here a worker
       holding a page pinned in `mi_heap_delete` through the exported #271 stall hook -- makes
       the reclaim refuse to run at all (`reclaimed == false`, nothing released, accounting
       unchanged), and it runs for real once that thread is out;
   A6  a live but PARKED worker (mi_on_thread_idle_start) does NOT block the reclaim: the claim
       protocol reaches it, which is the whole point of doing this through #366's park states.

   HOW THE ARENAS ARE FORCED

   `mi_option_arena_reserve` is in KiB (`mi_option_has_size_in_kib`, src/options.c) with a 1 GiB
   default; the row lowers it to its 32 MiB minimum. `mi_arena_reserve` then over-reserves by
   `MI_ARENA_MAX_CHUNK_OBJ_SIZE` (32 MiB), so a 32 MiB object's page -- 513 slices, one more than
   the 512-slice b-bitmap chunk -- reserves 96 MiB, and a second such object does NOT fit beside
   it: a request larger than one chunk is met from whole free chunks, and after one object at
   most one chunk is left. Each big object therefore gets an arena of its own, and the first
   small allocation in the process likewise reserves an arena (`mi_arena_reserve` runs for it
   too). A1 MEASURES that size per object instead of hardcoding it, so the rows below stay exact
   on any platform. Process-wide state (the scavenger, anything the C++ runtime allocated) is
   not assumed away either: the rows assert on DELTAS and on the live objects, and A1 pins the
   one precondition it does need -- "the process had no arena yet" -- by name, so a failure
   there is diagnosable rather than mysterious.

   Threading is modelled on test-purge-all.cpp (platform threads, never <thread>: some
   mingw-w64 toolchains ship the win32 threads model). A hang fails through ctest's TIMEOUT. */
